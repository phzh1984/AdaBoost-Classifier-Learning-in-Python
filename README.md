# AdaBoost-Classifier-Learning-in-Python

AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is an ensemble learning technique that aims to improve the performance of weak learners (classifiers that perform slightly better than random chance) and combine them to create a strong classifier. In the context of classification, AdaBoost assigns weights to training instances and adjusts them during the training process, giving more emphasis to misclassified instances. The final prediction is then made by combining the weak learners' predictions, with more weight given to those that perform better.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of implementing AdaBoost Classifier in Python:

Explanation of key steps:

Import Libraries: Import the necessary libraries, including AdaBoostClassifier from scikit-learn, as well as other tools for dataset handling and evaluation.

Load Data: Load your dataset. In this example, the Iris dataset is used. Replace it with your dataset.

Split Data: Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Create Weak Learner: Define a weak learner. In this case, a decision tree with a maximum depth of 1 is used. You can replace it with other weak learners as needed.

Create AdaBoost Classifier: Instantiate the AdaBoostClassifier, passing the weak learner and specifying the number of boosting rounds (n_estimators).

Train the Classifier: Use the fit method to train the AdaBoost classifier on the training data.

Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.

Evaluate Accuracy: Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy.

Adjust parameters like n_estimators and the base learner's parameters to optimize the model for your specific problem.
